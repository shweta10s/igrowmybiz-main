                <p className="text-base">
                    The goddess Durga is honored at the Hindu festival of Navratri. Several individuals fast and hold rites in the goddess’ honor over the course of the nine-night festival. Usually, dance, prayer, and fasting are used to mark the occasion. Some businesses use the hashtag #Navaratri [further hashtags are provided below] to share festive material with their followers on social media during Navratri.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-white/70 font-bold text-lg">OBJECTIVE OF THE CAMPAIGN:</h2>
                <p className="text-base">
                    Navratri is one of the most anticipated festivals in India – especially for NRIs & Indian-Origin residents who get to socialize with other people in the community. After  the pandemic period, Navratri couldn’t be celebrated with the same zest and it was this sentiment that inspired the campaign to promote on social media platforms so that we can easily connect with people and  spread the happiness of this festival.
                    <br />
                    The campaign aimed to showcase the variations in  colors of Navratri 2023 using herbal & organic products

                <p className="text-base">
                    Brands celebrate Navaratri on social media by posting religious content, holding competitions, and offering discounts. Religious content includes posts about the story of Navaratri and the goddess Durga. Competitions are usually based around guessing the correct number of Navaratri days or sharing recipes. Discounts are usually given on Navaratri-related products such as books, music, and movies. By celebrating Navaratri on social media, brands connect with their Hindu customers and promote their products and services.
